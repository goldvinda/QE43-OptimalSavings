# Cake Eating I: Introduction to Optimal Saving

This is Quantecon Lecture 43: Intro to Optimal Savings

## Overview

In this lecture we introduce a simple “cake eating” problem.

The intertemporal problem is: how much to enjoy today and how much to leave
for the future?

Although the topic sounds trivial, this kind of trade-off between current
and future utility is at the heart of many savings and consumption problems.

Once we master the ideas in this simple environment, we will apply them to
progressively more challenging—and useful—problems.

The main tool we will use to solve the cake eating problem is dynamic programming.
